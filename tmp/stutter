Disclaimer: Stuttering comes in many different types and magnitudes. I personally experience blocks while speaking as what I would describe as a mild stutter. As much as I would love to speak - and speak out - for all people who stutter (PWS), I can't. The experiences of fellow PWS might fundamentally differ to mine. Please take the following lines as an _unscientific_ testimonial of the experiences I've made throughout my life.

## What this could be about, but it is not
This could be about the panic, the horror when getting stuck in the middle of a conference talk. Not being able to get that one fucking word out while the audience seems irritated.  
This could be about the overwhelming shame for creating the social situation where neither me nor my students seem to know how to handle the unexpected, sudden silence in my lecture. Although I can't rationally explain as to why I would feel guilt for something I have no control over, I am not able to withhold eye contact.  
This could be about choosing to stay silent instead of networking at a conference with a colleague I've read so many articles of and I'm excited to see.  
This could be about the physical (and mental) exhaustion after a 90 minute lecture with only minor, calm stutters on the surface. But with an ocean of near-stutters that I evaded by pressing words out against closed vocal cords.  
This could be about the feeling that stuttering is something kids do when developing speech and the hope that - once I'm an adult - I would have grown out of it. Scientists on the other side use precise language, converse eloquently with ease and fluently hold panel discussions for their audiences. Scientists don't stutter.  
  
This blog post is not about that (if you want to get to know stuttering from the perspective of PWS though, the subreddit r/stutter can be a start). I'm going to put all this in the "dive into a sea of self-pity" drawer and close it shut for a second. But you can take one thing away from these first lines: Stuttering can be very much impactful on the lives of PWS. Not convinced by anecdotal evidence? Check out this meta-analysis ([Craig & Tran, 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfludis.2014.01.001)) on the relation of stuttering and higher trait and social anxiety for example. And we make up approx. 1% of the population - that makes about 800,000 people in my home country Germany alone.  
  
Throughout this post I'll be referring to Joe Biden several times. If you didn't know that Joe Biden stutters, that kind of already supports two points I want to make:

    1. Most times stuttering doesn't sound like you think it does and you will therefore be likely to misinterpret it.
    2. Stuttering has a weak lobby.

## Stuttering probably doesn't sound like you think it does
A couple years back I was having a drink with two of my best friends that I knew since more than 15 years. When one friend mentioned that I stutter the other one expressed his honest astonishment "You stutter? I always thought you're just too dim to remember words."  
  
Stuttering can easily be misinterpreted, "the public" doesn't normally get too much in contact with stuttering. One (of many) reasons is, that PWS tend to avoid situations where they know they will stutter or 'cheat' their way around. When I sit with a group of friends and want to add something to the conversation but know I will stutter, I stay silent. When I want to order a Pizza Margherita but know I will stutter, it's gonna be a Pizza Funghi. Either way I dodged the stutter and you didn't hear how it sounds.  

When PWS get portrayed in pop culture, it's mostly people with a severe case of stuttering like Ken in "A Fish Called Wanda" or Bobby in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". We can always argue about how accurate stuttering is portrayed, but that's not the point here. The point is: In cases the public gets into contact with stuttering it tends to be severe stuttering. Therefore the stereotype of stuttering is just that - a dichotomy of a severe stutter vs. no stutter.

The way I hold presentations on the other hand I often use "er" to get my breath going (to avoid stuttering) and my speech lacks modulation and variation (because I concentrate on pressing words out). Alltogether that might just make you think that I didn't prepare well enough or it looks like I'm not able to concentrate or that I'm just a bad presenter. A presentation I did at the Open Social Sciences Conference 2019 is a good example of that. I was super excited for this opportunity, as it was my first real chance to become part of the open science community, with some big role models in the audience. So (together with a colleague) I programmed a web-app and prepared the presentation with a lot of dedication. Until 4am the night before, I rehearsed the presentation. On the next day, sadly, my stutter was more severe. When it was my time to present I looked like I hardly know what I'm doing - compared to how I could have slayed it. The presentation was live streamed and recorded for youtube. Till this day it is tough for me to watch the recording, because I feel like this makes me look like a half senile, half lost person put in front of an audience to perform powerpoint karaoke. At least I'm waring pants - dignity: check.  

This is how stuttering might also look and sound. I perceive it quite different from stereotypical portrays of stuttering:

So in my case, misinterpretations of stuttering as a lack of preparation or incompetence that I both experienced before, may unlimately lower my chances of success in academia. Big deal. In the case of Joe Biden, however, (deliberate?) misinterpretations may have a much bigger impact. Finding videos where Joe Biden stutters is easy. But his stuttering is not described as such, it is described as ["Biden losing his marbles"](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2902589796468116). Take this speech for example:  
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://video.foxnews.com/v/embed.js?id=6079949740001&w=466&h=263"></script><noscript>Watch the latest video at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com">foxnews.com</a></noscript>  
  
Biden appears to "forget" Obamas name as the reporters claim. That abductive reasoning does not seem not very probable to me. Biden may not always hold the most coherent speeches, but in this case it seems as if he stuttered (I'm not taking any political side here). Replacing words with near synonyms is "How to avoid stutter blocks 101". Like Biden here, I do it every day: Experiencing a block - relaxing the diaphragm and breathing in - replacing the word with something else - going on without showing that I was feeling like near suffocation. As a PWS who experiences blocks on a regular basis I know how they look. That shit is my daily routine since I was four. Although Biden already publicly spoke about his speech impediment several times ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWn1CkIU_rc), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jMM2TazlcM), etc.), his stutters are treated like signs of dementia or serious cognitive deficits. I'm not going to be the judge about whether or not people should be concerned about Biden's cognitive fitness as a presidential candidate. However, labelling his stutters as forgetfulness and making it contribute to a picture of "Slow Joe" who is not quite right in the head, is incredibly hurtful to people who suffer from this legally defined disability. Are we actually seen as more nervous, less intelligent, less attractive and less like a leader as [this study by Walden and Lesner (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfludis.2018.06.001) might indicate?

Over the course of my professional career I got questions like "Ha ha, did you forget the name of your colleague?" more than I can think of. As much as I truly believe that this was never said with bad intentions: Boy, do I wish more people would educate themselves about the variety of how stuttering sounds. Call me pessimistic, but I don't think that this will happen any time soon. Why? Because PWS have a weak lobby.

## Stuttering has a weak lobby
As every moring I was listening to my favourite newspaper podcast. The incident in the video above (no not mine, the Biden one) was discussed. As expected the news reporters interpreted it as Biden forgetting Obamas name and were (to put it delicately) _amused_ about the apparent disorientation Biden displayed. I can come up with two explanations for that reaction: Either they didn't know Joe Biden stutters or they know and don't care. Both possibilities indicate that stuttering has a weak lobby.

I wrote a public comment and contacted the podcast hosts directly arguing that their reaction might not be fully appropriate. What I found out was, that neither any of the hosts, nor the US foreign correspondent were aware that Joe Biden stutters. The correspondent had written several lengthy articles about Biden before, which I found on the newspaper's homepage. Why didn't he know that Biden stutters? Biden talked about it publicly several times ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWn1CkIU_rc), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jMM2TazlcM), etc.) and it's even in his bloody [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Presidency_of_Joe_Biden)!? Is suffering from a stutter so irrelevant that it is okay to be overlooked? Or was "not knowing" just a way to avoid admitting they knowingly laughed about a disability? Pick your poison I guess.

I don't suppose people laughed behind my back after they met me in a professional context. What I can say, however, is that a weak lobby for stutterers in academia manifests itself in bewildered looks while giving a talk, not being taken serious because of an unability to display a certain habitus or not being payed attention while taking ages to deliver a counterargument. To my knowledge there appears to be little effort to eradicate discriminatory practices  that constitute systematic barriers for PWS. Inclusion and participation of PWS in academia is (at least at my research institute) rather in its infancy. As [this great paper by Dane Isaacs (2020)](http://doi.org/10.16993/sjdr.601) shows, this is not a singular problem.

## So...?
If you care, there are two things:
First, __educate yourself about stuttering__. Get to know the different variations how stuttering sounds. What is stuttering to PWS? What is it to you or to our society?  
Second, inquire if you can __build advocacy for PWS__. Is there a guideline on inclusive pedagogy in courses? Is there a policy on equal opportunities for job announcements and hiring?

So until we managed to built the lobby, I try to stay [artzyAtFailing2](https://twitter.com/artzyatfailing2).
